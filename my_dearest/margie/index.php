				<p><span>My dearest Margie</span></p>
				<p>Where do I even begin?</p>
				<p>I'm certain that you've heard the words "I'm sorry" enough to the point that they have lost all meaning. I'm certain that your supporters number many; and that one more pair of souls wishing you well, particularly those a world away, would be nothing more than a drop in the bucket of those you have undeniably touched and affected.</p>
				<p>But, please know that both my and my better half's best wishes are with you through this difficult time. I cannot even begin to imagine your difficulties through these days. But news of your fiery resolve makes its way across the ocean, and I am instantly reminded of the beloved aunt that, both within me and herself, always cultivated a sense of aspiration to something more than we are or could ever be; a drive that is somehow distant, and yet that has always been right beside me all along.</p>
				<p>I'm also certain that you are beyond overwhelmed with your situation. But should you ever have a moment for a word or two, I have found <a href="skype:Mike.of.the.Jungle?call">Skype</a> to be most effective. Once the weather warms and clears, I'm hoping to be able to make a visit to Chicago. I would absolutely cherish a visit with you. It's a shame that it wasn't possible during the most recent visit, but I'll keep you posted as to a future visit. </p>
				<p>But until then, our best wishes are with you.</p>
